# Cyprus-UTM-grids
This is not pretty, but it gets the job done. Ideally this would be a function; also, could probably be much more easily achieved with the sf package.

The UTM grid used here is EPSG:32636 (https://epsg.io/32636)

Note that KMZ file breaks down on zooming in, apparently this is something with not having 
the "tesellate" flag in the KML.
